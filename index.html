            The operating mechanism can even be thrown into action independently of any object to operate upon 
            (although of course no result could then be developed). Again, it might act upon other things besides number, were 
            objects found whose mutual fundamental relations could be expressed by those of the abstract science of operations, 
            and which should be also susceptible of adaptations to the action of the operating notation and mechanism of the engine. 
            Supposing, for instance, that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in the science of harmony and of musical composition 
            were susceptible of such expression and adaptations, the engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any 
            degree of complexity or extent."
